        <h2>üìú About Me! </h2>
        <p>
         I am a student at the University of California - Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Engineering. I love to learn about the relationships between the hardware and software side of computers and how everything is all connected!
        </p>

        <p>
         For fun, I love to program bots and make cool programming projects, such as the one you are seeing right now! Aside from programming, I love to play games such as League of Legends and CS:GO and hang out with my friends. One of my favorite sports is skateboarding, but I do not know too many tricks. I also love to play tennis!
        </p>

        <p>
          Some random facts about me: My favorite language is Java, I love old Kanye West's songs, and my favorite videogame is Terraria!

        <p1>
          A bot made using PRAW and Selenium libraries using Python. The main purpose was to reduce the stress of my parent's by having certain posts from Reddit be sent to them through WhatsApp (since its the only platform they use) with a single press of a button!

        <p2>
          A database designed to help Pokemon trainers along their journey to become Pokemon Masters! Using PostgresSQL, my classmate and I implemented an item storage model into a physical database through the creation of tables containing foreign key-primary key relationships, inserting sample data, and views.

        <h1>üñ•Ô∏èBudget Gaming PC Build</h1>
        <p4>
          In the Spring of 2020, I built myself a gaming PC using a budget of only ~$500. Components include RX 570, Ryzen 5 2600, 500GB M.2 SSD, and PSU (with 3 fans).
