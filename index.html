        <h2>üìú About Me! </h2>
        <p>
         Hey yall! I am a Computer Engineering major at UCSC planning on doing a systems programming concentration. 
          My goals lie in wanting to apply software technologies to other fields, like healthcare, e-commerce, business, and more! 
          In the field of tech, I want to be able to apply this knowledge on unorthodox industries and automate tedious processes!
        </p>

        <p>
         For fun, I love to integrate technologies towards wacky applications of life. Right now, I am working an application that combines
          web development and fitness (so stay tuned for that!).
          Aside from programming, I love to lift heavy weights at the gym and see the positive impact it makes on my mental state and my physical well-being. Additionally, I am always
          trying to spend my time trying new things, like futsal, concert festivals, and meeting new people. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some random facts about me: My favorite body builder is Chris Bumstead, my favorite anime is One Piece, and I like to put Sriracha on everything non-sweet.

          A bot made using PRAW and Selenium libraries using Python. The main purpose was to reduce the stress of my parent's by having certain posts from Reddit be sent to them through WhatsApp (since its the only platform they use) with a single press of a button!

        <p>
          Under Professor David Lee, I worked in a research lab where I could make technology for social good. As a Web Developer, I helped implement designs into actual code based on Figma designs. From this, I learned many crucial skills in web development such as styling formatting, and Git tools. Now, I am working on the "Containers" team where I utilize RxJs and Angular Store to retreive data from the database (Firestore), and make it easier for UI teams to bind the data.
